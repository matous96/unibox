# Unibox

### One store for every app on Windows

A modern app store for Windows 10 and 11. More than **25,000 apps** from the official
WinGet, Chocolatey and Scoop repositories – install them in one click, without hunting
for installers on the web, with no ads and no bundled extras.

## Why Unibox

| 🛡️ Safe – no viruses | ⚡ Simple | 🔄 Everything under control |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Only the official repositories of package managers. Every installer is verified against its SHA-256 checksum before it runs. | One click instead of setup wizards. No “Next, Next, Finish”, no bundled extras and no ads. | Updates and uninstalls for all your apps in one place – even the ones you installed earlier and some other way. |

One app = one card. When an app is available from several package managers, its card
shows every source with its version and you choose where to install it from.

## Tour

### Store and catalog

A **Today** home page with tips from hundreds of well-known apps and a new App of the Day
every day, categories, charts and collections for gamers, creators, students and
developers. Search with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> covers the catalog and searches
package managers live; verified apps come first.

### App pages like in the App Store

A large banner in the colors of the app's icon, a screenshot gallery with a full-screen
viewer, what's new, ratings and reviews, privacy details and links to the website,
GitHub, documentation and support. Technical details: SHA-256, installer type, system
requirements and dependencies.

Install in one click from the source you choose, with download progress right on the app page.

### Installed apps and updates

An overview of every app on your computer – including programs installed outside WinGet,
Microsoft Store apps and Steam games. Install updates with one **Update all** button or
automatically on a schedule. When an operation fails because of permissions, Unibox
retries it with administrator rights by itself.

### And more

- 🧹 **Advanced uninstall** – finds what uninstallers leave behind (AppData, Program Files,
  the Start menu, the registry) and offers to delete it; with **install tracking** it
  removes exactly what the installer created.
- 🚀 **Startup apps** – programs that start when you sign in to Windows, in one place,
  with their impact on startup speed.
- ⏰ **Updates under control** – schedules for checks and installs, a minimum age for
  updates, battery exceptions and a warning when an installer comes from a different host.
- 📦 **Package bundles and profiles** – a shareable set of apps for a new PC, export for
  WinGet or as a PowerShell script.
- 💻 **Developer mode** – npm, Bun, pip, Cargo, vcpkg, .NET Tool and PowerShell for real,
  plus command-line commands ready to copy.
- ⭐ **Community** – sign in with GitHub, ratings, reviews and current screenshots from
  users; sync your favorites and preferences between computers.
- 🌙 **A modern window** in the Windows 11 style, light and dark theme, English and Czech;
  close the window and installs finish in the background.

## Package managers

| Manager | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **WinGet** | ✅ fully working | search, install, update, uninstall and download installers |
| **Chocolatey** | ✅ fully working | search, install, update and uninstall; installs Chocolatey itself if it's missing |
| **Scoop** | ✅ fully working | no administrator rights needed; adds a missing Scoop, Git and buckets by itself |
| **npm, Bun, pip, Cargo, vcpkg, .NET Tool, PowerShell** | ✅ Developer mode | libraries and tools; installs a missing Node.js, Python or Rust via WinGet |

## Download

**[Download the latest version](https://github.com/matous96/unibox/releases/latest)** –
the **EXE** installer installs for the current user without administrator rights, the
**MSI** suits company deployments. Requirements: Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit) and WebView2,
which comes preinstalled with Windows. Unibox then keeps itself up to date. More on the
website: [matous96.github.io/unibox](https://matous96.github.io/unibox/en/index.html).

> [!NOTE]
> The installer isn't digitally signed yet (signing through the SignPath Foundation is
> on the way). Edge may say the file "isn't commonly downloaded" (**… → Keep → Show more →
> Keep anyway**) and Windows SmartScreen shows a warning on the first run
> (**More info → Run anyway**).

## Free and open source

Unibox is free, with no ads and no telemetry, under the [MIT](LICENSE) license. The
catalog is generated every day on GitHub Actions; sign-in, ratings and sync run on the
free tier of Supabase. Signing in is optional – everything except ratings, reviews and
sync works without an account.

## For developers

Tauri 2 (Rust) + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Vite, with a data pipeline in
Node.js. Requirements: Node.js 24, pnpm 10 and, for the desktop app, Rust and Visual Studio
Build Tools with C++.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev                # web version with sample data at http://localhost:1420
pnpm desktop            # desktop app (Tauri) with hot reload – one test version (org.unibox.dev, DevTools on port 9222), runs next to an installed Unibox
pnpm pipeline --local   # build the real catalog into public/catalog.json
pnpm typecheck          # type checks
```

### Code signing

`pnpm release` signs `unibox.exe`, the NSIS installer, its uninstaller and the MSI
automatically when a certificate is set in the environment. Tauri calls
[`scripts/sign.mjs`](scripts/sign.mjs) for each file (`bundle.windows.signCommand`), which
runs `signtool.exe` from the Windows SDK with SHA-256 and an RFC 3161 timestamp. Without a
certificate the build is unsigned and says so; a certificate that is set but can't be used
(wrong password, missing token) stops the build.

| Environment variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNIBOX_SIGN_PFX`, `UNIBOX_SIGN_PFX_PASSWORD` | a `.pfx` file with the certificate and key, and its password |
| `UNIBOX_SIGN_THUMBPRINT` | instead of a `.pfx`: the SHA-1 thumbprint of a certificate in the Windows store (Current User → Personal) – also a token or cloud HSM its driver exposes there |
| `UNIBOX_SIGN_TIMESTAMP_URL`, `UNIBOX_SIGNTOOL` | optional: another timestamp server, the path to `signtool.exe` |

**Local test certificate** – a self-signed code signing certificate for trying it out
(`signtool.exe` comes with the Windows SDK, e.g. "Windows 11 SDK" in Visual Studio Installer):

```powershell
pnpm sign:dev-cert   # creates %USERPROFILE%\.tauri\unibox-dev-signing.pfx and .cer, prints a password
$env:UNIBOX_SIGN_PFX = "$env:USERPROFILE\.tauri\unibox-dev-signing.pfx"
$env:UNIBOX_SIGN_PFX_PASSWORD = "<the printed password>"
pnpm release -- --no-bump   # signed build without changing the version
Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe | Format-List
```

Status `UnknownError` (untrusted root) is expected – Windows doesn't trust the certificate.
On a **test machine only** you can trust it, so UAC shows the publisher "Unibox (dev)":

```powershell
Import-Certificate -FilePath "$env:USERPROFILE\.tauri\unibox-dev-signing.cer" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root
# after testing:
Get-ChildItem Cert:\CurrentUser\Root | Where-Object Subject -like 'CN=Unibox (dev)*' | Remove-Item
```

**SmartScreen while testing locally:** SmartScreen only checks files marked as downloaded
from the internet (Mark of the Web). An installer you built yourself has no mark, so
SmartScreen doesn't show up for it at all. For a copy you downloaded (from GitHub, through a
browser) and test on your own machine, `Unblock-File .\Unibox_<version>_x64-setup.exe`
removes the mark. Smart App Control in Windows 11 is a separate check – when it's on, it
may still block unsigned or self-signed builds. For other people, only a certificate from
a trusted authority plus reputation removes the warning (free for open source: SignPath
Foundation, see the Czech docs). Never distribute builds signed with the development
certificate. Certificates and passwords don't
belong in the repository (`.gitignore` skips `*.pfx`, `*.p12`, `*.key`).

The full developer documentation – Supabase setup, signing, releases, the catalog and
every app feature – is in Czech in [README.cs.md](README.cs.md#dokumentace-pro-vývojáře).
